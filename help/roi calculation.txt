Help information for ROI Calculation:
    
roi file: ROIs in one nifti file
roi index(*): optional. labels of tagged ROIs in an .csv file. For example:
    1,SFG
    2,MFG
    3,IFG
clustersize thr: threshold of cluster size.
    
mask: could be whole brain mask or gray matter mask.
id index: identifier to find unique string for each subject
filetype: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
4D nifti files: if the input data is 4D, check this item. Otherwise uncheck.
input dirs: directories can be input either using a .txt file or spm select window.
    
extract mean: extract mean time series for each ROI
roi to roi correlation: calculate correlation between pairs of ROI
roi to whole brain correlation: calculate correlation between each ROI's mean time series and voxels in the mask.
    
Partial correlation: (check to use Partial Pearson's correlation, uncheck to use Pearson's correlation) when calculating correlation, between one roi mean time series and voxels/other time series, the rest of roi mean time serieses will be regressed out from the calculation.
    
out dir: output directory for saving results.
    
Buttons:
    S: Save parameters of the current panel to a *.mat file. The *.mat can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
    L: Load parameters from *.mat for the current panel.
