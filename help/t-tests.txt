Help information for Statistics:
    
data: matrix
    symmetric matrix: check to extract the upper right matrix's elements, uncheck to extract all elements
data: volume
    mask: could be whole brain mask or gray matter mask.
    
filetype: filetype
data dir: Input directories of matrices.
    
grouping info:
    stat type: one sample t-test, two sample t-test and paired t-test.
    groups:
        for two sample t-test, e.g. SZ,NC -> will do two-sample t-test for SZ and NC
        for paired t-test, e.g. SZ,NC -> will do paired t-test for SZ and NC
        for one sample t-test, e.g. SZ;NC -> will do one-sample t-test for both SZ and NC group
    
    table: A comma-seperated values (csv) table, which is used for parsing subject names and covariates. The parsed names/ids will be matched to search results conducted with datadir and filetype. Before matching, BRANT will remove specified strings.
	
    For one and two sample t-tests:
        name , group, filter, age
        subj1 , SZ, center1, 28
        subj2 , SZ, center1, 27
        subj3 , NC, center1, 30
        subj4 , NC, center2, 25
	
    For paired t-test, another column of paired_t_idx is required to specify paired subjects in each group:
        name , group, filter, age, paired_t_idx
        subj1 , stage1, center1, 28, 1
        subj2 , stage1, center1, 27, 2
        subj3 , stage2, center1, 30, 1
        subj4 , stage2, center2, 25, 2

    string removal*: optional. remove strings from search results parsed by id index.
    regressors*: optional. title of regressors which will be regressed out before statistical analysis. e.g. age
    filter*: optional. use the control for subject in different state or center, fill in center1 here and subject4 won't be included in the analysis.
    discard subjects without info: when checked, if subjects' information are not found in the table, a warning message will be shown; when unchecked, an error message will be shown.
    
Multiple comparison correction methods (voxel-wise)
    threshold: the level of MULCC
    fdrID: false discovery rate (independent input)
    fdrN: false discovery rate (inputs not independent)
    bonf: Bonferroni correction for family wise error rate
    
out dir: output directory for saving results.
    
Buttons:
    S: Save parameters of the current panel to a *.mat file. The *.mat can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
    L: Load parameters from *.mat for the current panel.
